      The code out here deals with our study of the Burgers equation, which is our
first exposure to a non-linear PDE. The Burgers equation and the Buckley-Leverett equation
are included. The goal here is to understand how shocks steepen, how an isolated shock
propagates and also how a rarefaction fan might form.

      The provided code uses a two-stage Runge-Kutta scheme which is coupled to 
an HLL Riemann solver.

      The distribution already provides all the worked examples. We have also 
provided the final images for all the worked examples, so you know what the 
final answer looks like. If you wish, you may (optionally) go into the individual 
folders and see how we have modified the codes for each of the examples. You may 
use our modifications to guide you in making your own modifications.

       Copy "nonlin_scalar_RK.src" to "nonlin_scalar_RK.F" and
modify as needed and run. The code solves the Burgers and Buckley-Leverett equations.
It is best to initially focus on Burgers equation, which is what we do here.
Both give rise to non-linear, scalar, hyperbolic PDEs. However, the Burgers flux is convex
while the Buckley-Leverett flux is non-convex. "mu" again controls the CFL number. "islope = 1, 2"
for MinMod or MC limiters. "tstop" is again the stopping time. The timestep is a two-stage
Runge-Kutta timestepping. 

"iproblem = 1" shows how a Gaussian, which is initially smooth, self-steepens into
a shock. Look for the folder "Burgers_Gaussian".

"iproblem = 2" produces a shock solution for the Burgers equation. Look for the
folder "Burgers_Shock".

"iproblem = 3" produces a rarefaction fan solution for the Burgers equation.
Look for the folder "Burgers_Rarefaction".
